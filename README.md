# ServerScout

ServerScout is an organization dedicated to creating tools that help Minecraft players find servers. We currently offer the following tools:

## Discord Bot

Our Discord bot can be added to your server to help your community find new servers to play on. The bot has a variety of search filters, including location, game mode, and player count, to help users find the perfect server for them. 

To add our bot to your Discord server, simply visit our [ADD TO SERVER]([https://serverscout.com](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1099633608521683045&permissions=274878285824&scope=bot)) and click on the "Add to Discord" button.

## Server Scanner

Our server scanner is a web-based tool that allows users to search for Minecraft servers based on a variety of criteria. This tool is especially useful for those looking for servers with specific mods, plugins, or versions. Users can filter servers based on location, game mode, player count, and more.

## Minecraft Fabric Mod

We also offer a Minecraft Fabric mod that adds new features to the game to help players find servers. The mod adds a server browser that allows players to easily search for servers based on location, game mode, player count, and more. It also includes a favorites list, so players can easily keep track of their favorite servers.

Our Minecraft Fabric mod can be downloaded from our [GitHub repository](https://example.com).

## Getting Started

To get started with any of our tools, simply access any of the repositories and clone or download the releases.
